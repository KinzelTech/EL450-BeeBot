Hi guys! This will be our Github Repo for any code we produce this semester. 
If you aren't already familar with Github I suggest you watch a few videos about it. 
We won't be doing much more than just using this as a file share though, so don't worry to much about the nitty-gritty.

For the time being, everyone should make their own branch and save their code there. 
When we start code integration we will create a combined branch.

See CODING STANDARDS for our team coding standards.
